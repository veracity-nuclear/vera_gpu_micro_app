## Project Overview
Contains micro-applications for prototyping of VERA GPU capabilities

Four micro-apps are defined in this repo, each with its own source
and test data:
1. MOC
2. CMFD
3. Conduction
4. Subchannel

Each of these focuses on a different computationally intensive portion
of the VERA solve.  Test data produced from VERA can be used to test
the accuracy and performance of the implementation.
